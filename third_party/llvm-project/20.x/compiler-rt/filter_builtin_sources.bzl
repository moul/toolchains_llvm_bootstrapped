Utilities used by compiler-rt BUILD rules.

`filter_builtin_sources` is a rule similar to filegroup, but it also ensures
that only the last occurrence of each basename is kept. This makes it possible
to list architecture specific builtins after the generic ones without pulling
both into the build. The rule also filters out the entries listed in
`lib/builtins/Darwin-excludes.txt` when building for macOS so that we match the
upstream Darwin build.
